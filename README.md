# Online-Aggregation-for-Crowdsourcing-Regression
Experimental codes for the algorithm Online Aggregation for Crowdsourcing Regression

As an effective and low-cost way to fetch training data from workers, crowdsourcing services
have become a popular choice for Internet giants. However, the obtained labels may be 
awed due to the errors and noise from annotation processes, which limits the performance of downstream data mining
tasks seriously. To address the issue, we propose Crowdsourcing Regression Online Aggregation Method,
a semi-supervised crowdsourcing regression algorithm based on normalized exponential gradient strategy.
This algorithm is capable of adjusting the degree of trust according to the performances of varied workers
dynamically and predicts new instances in an online way. In addition, we prove that our method has a low
regret bound and show its effectiveness via multiple numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world
crowdsourcing datasets.
